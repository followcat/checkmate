description: "Simplify application/component definition.

    There is a need to be able to create new application more easily.
    Support for easier application definition allow to create different
    applications dedicated to particular purposes.

    It is necessary to define new application that are not linked to
    the partition definition machinery so that doctests using them are
    less exposed to failure from side effect.

    - feature: Exchange defined with definition configuration
      description: "Remove unconfigured exchange define code.

        Exchanges should be defined only based on definition configuration. No
        default searching and parsing yaml files to define exchange if no
        exchange definition configuration set. 
        "
      example: "
            >>> import checkmate.application\n
            >>> import sample_app.application\n
            >>> d = {}\n
            >>> d['__module__'] = 'sample_app.application'\n
            >>> d['application_definition'] = {'component_classes': {}}\n
            >>> app = checkmate.application.ApplicationMeta('GenericApp',\n

        "

    - feature: Make code in ApplicationMeta and ComponentMeta similar
      description: "Application and component metaclasses share code.

        The two classes have similar functions:
            - creating modules
            - reading partition definitions
            - creating partition classes

        Both application and component metaclasses are given a dictionary for
        initialization with common set of keys.

      example: "
            >>> import checkmate.component
            >>> import checkmate.application
            >>> import sample_app.application
            >>> d = {}
            >>> d['__module__'] = 'sample_app.application'

    - feature: Define a simple default engine for component
      description: "Define a default engine.

        The default engine is used when a component that has no configuration
        data about partition. The component must then define exchanges and
        state in the format supported by the default engine.
        "

    - feature: Exchange definition in component
      description: "Move the exchange partition parsing into component.

        The exchange partitions are needed for component initialization. The
        exchanges are created in exchange module that is passed for each
        component. As long as the definition is available, it does not matter
        if the parsing is done in application or component metaclasses.
        "
      example: "
            >>> import yaml
            >>> import collections

    - feature: Definition of new components inside component
      description: "Comoonent definition inside component.

        As the code of application and component metaclasses are more similar
        the existing application should be split in two:
            - the actions that can be done by component is moved to a new 
                component. Each application is defining its own component.
                This component is defining more components.
            - the actions that are application specific are kept there.
