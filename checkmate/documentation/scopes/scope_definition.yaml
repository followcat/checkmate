branch: scope_definition
description: """Add scope definition to development branch.

    Development branches with long history are error prone.
    It is important that when opening a branch, the scope is clearly
    defined so that the life duration is under control. A clear scope
    also helps to avoid unrelated feature to be added in a branch.
    Unrelated feature should be avoided to keep the impacted set of
    files consistent, helping to prevent conflicts when concurrently
    implementing features in different branches."""

    - feature: definition of scope using yaml,
      description: """Scope definition is done using yaml syntax.

        It has a non testable description of the target of the development.
        If will highlight the benefit for the program to implement that
        target. It is used for documentation of the code released after
        development branch is merged.

        If the branch is leading to the introduction of a new module, a valid
        description could be seen as the module docstring."""

      example:
        >>> import checkmate._scope
        >>> sco = checkmate._scope.Scope("""

        ...         description:

      description: """Features are breakdown of the branch target.

        The breakdown must be done so that each feature is independent
        from the ones that follow. Still each feature should be complete
        and leave the code in a state that passes the regression tests."""
